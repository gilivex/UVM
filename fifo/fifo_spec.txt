Here's a specification sheet for the given FIFO (First-In, First-Out) buffer module written in Verilog:

## FIFO Specification Sheet

### Module Overview

The `fifo` module is a parameterized FIFO buffer, which allows for temporary storage and retrieval of data in a first-in, first-out manner. The module is parameterizable in terms of address width (`AWIDTH`) and data width (`DWIDTH`).

### Parameter Declarations

- **AWIDTH**: Address width (default value: 4)
- **DWIDTH**: Data width (default value: 4)

### Port Declarations

- **Inputs**:
  - `clk`: Clock signal.
  - `rst`: Reset signal (active high).
  - `write_en`: Write enable signal (active high).
  - `read_en`: Read enable signal (active high).
  - `data_in`: Data input bus of width `DWIDTH`.

- **Outputs**:
  - `full`: Full flag, indicates if the FIFO is full (active high).
  - `empty`: Empty flag, indicates if the FIFO is empty (active high).
  - `data_out`: Data output bus of width `DWIDTH`, registered output.

### Internal Variable Declarations

- **Local Parameters**:
  - `DEPTH`: Depth of the FIFO memory, calculated as `2^AWIDTH`.

- **Registers**:
  - `mem[0:DEPTH-1]`: Memory array for storing the data, with `DEPTH` number of entries, each of width `DWIDTH`.
  - `wptr`: Write pointer of width `AWIDTH`.
  - `rptr`: Read pointer of width `AWIDTH`.
  - `wrote`: Status flag indicating if the last operation was a write operation.

### Functional Description

- **Reset Behavior**: On a reset (`rst`), the read pointer (`rptr`), write pointer (`wptr`), and the write status flag (`wrote`) are reset to zero.
  
- **Write Operation**: When `write_en` is asserted and the FIFO is not full, the data from `data_in` is written to the memory at the location pointed to by `wptr`, then the write pointer (`wptr`) is incremented by one, and the write status flag (`wrote`) is set to one.

- **Read Operation**: When `read_en` is asserted and the FIFO is not empty, the data from the memory at the location pointed to by `rptr` is assigned to `data_out`, the read pointer (`rptr`) is incremented by one, and the write status flag (`wrote`) is cleared to zero.

- **Empty Flag (`empty`)**: The FIFO is considered empty when the read and write pointers are equal and the last operation was not a write (`wrote` is zero).

- **Full Flag (`full`)**: The FIFO is considered full when the read and write pointers are equal and the last operation was a write (`wrote` is one).

### Timing Diagram Example

Below is an example timing diagram demonstrating typical read and write operations with a FIFO:

```
clk        : |‾‾‾|__|‾‾‾|__|‾‾‾|__|‾‾‾|__|‾‾‾|__|‾‾‾|__|
rst        : |‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|________|
write_en   : |____|‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|______________________|‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|
read_en    : |________________|‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|_____________________|
data_in    : |____|  A  |____|  B  |____|  C  |____|  D  |____|  E  |
data_out   : |____|_____|____|  A  |____|  B  |____|  C  |____|____|
empty      : |‾‾‾|___________|‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|______________|‾‾‾|
full       : |____|___________|_____________________|_________|____|
```

In this example:
- Data `A` is written to the FIFO when `write_en` is high.
- Data `A` is read from the FIFO when `read_en` is high.
- The `empty` flag is high initially and becomes low after the first write.
- The `full` flag becomes high when the FIFO is full and resets when data is read.

### Important Notes

- The FIFO module uses a simple read and write pointer mechanism to manage data flow.
- It is crucial to ensure proper synchronization of the control signals (`write_en`, `read_en`) with the clock (`clk`) to avoid any potential data corruption.
- The FIFO does not handle simultaneous read and write operations. The logic should be designed to avoid asserting both `read_en` and `write_en` at the same time, unless additional handling is implemented.

This specification sheet should provide a clear overview of the FIFO module's functionality, parameters, and typical usage within a digital system.
